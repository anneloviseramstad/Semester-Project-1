              Come on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can
              learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not
              travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our
              exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so
              make sure you come ready to learn and explore.

              During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you
              can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery.
              Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more
              about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.
