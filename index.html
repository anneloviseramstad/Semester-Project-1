          <h3>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h3>
          <p>
            On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
            exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series
            of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
            elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
            ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control
            wind to create power.
