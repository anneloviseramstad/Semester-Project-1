          There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very
          welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and

              You can also support us by donating items of interest to the
              museum’s collections.
            </p>

              If you have some item or collection that you think others would
              enjoy, please let us know by contacting our Collections Department

            <strong>VOLUNTEER</strong>
            <p>
              A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
              displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
              Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
              scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
              monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
              discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please
              contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get
              involved.
